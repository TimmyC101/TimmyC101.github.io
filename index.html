                <!-- About Me-->
                <span class="popup ztop" id="Tim-popup">I have a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin.  During my time at Chevron as a data analyst, I taught myself Visual Basic in order to streamline and improve various processes, and created custom tools to improve efficiency and allow for quick and easy analysis of data.  
                    <br><br>It was during that time that I discovered my passion for programming;  so I packed up my belongings and moved to Denver in order to enroll in the Software Development Course at The Tech Academy in Denver, Colorado, which I have recently completed.
                    <br><br>Loki (pictured) is my pup.  He enjoys playing, playing, and sometimes when he is a little tired, playing.
                    <br><br>Personally, I enjoy staying active by hiking and playing sports.  When I'm not doing that, you will generally find me dragonslaying with my friends via online or tabletop games.
